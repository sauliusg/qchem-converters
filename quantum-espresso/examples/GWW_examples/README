to run examples do

./run_example 

from the following directories: 

example01 computes the GW quasi-particle energies in C6H6 (Benzene molecule) 

example02 computes the GW quasi-particle energies in bulk Si (extended system)
           Note: in order to accelerate this example, used as a daily distribution test,
               it is using parameters giving particularly unconverged results, the
               user should find a better example on gww.qe-forge.org

example03 computes the orbital decomposition of the total GWW density of states in C6H6 (Benzene molecule)
