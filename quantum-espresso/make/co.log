     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.0E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -66.74374687 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      34.44998683 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -9.88010665 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -0.93590131 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   5 iterations

     Total force =     0.000063     Total SCF correction =     0.000008
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values
