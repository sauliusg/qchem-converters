# Selected CI with perturbation correction (1 frozen core) geometry
# optimization of the second 1A1 state of H2O in a 6-31g* basis in C2v.
# (the final geometry is linear, one component of a linear 1PI state)

# There are two tasks.  The first defines the CI+PT wavefunction at the
# initial geometry.  The second performs the optimization.

# Because only totally symmetric modes have non-zero gradients and the
# CI+PT also uses symmetry, the speed-up from using symmetry with numerical
# derivatives is proportional to the square of the number of irreducible
# representations.

# There is no print control in the CI so you'll get LOTS of output
